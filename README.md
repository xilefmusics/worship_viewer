# Worhsip Viewer

## About

Worship Viewer is a program to manage, transpose and display chord sheets.
It is developed to meet all my and hopefully your needs during a worship session from a musician's, singer's, but also technical point of view (displaying the song via beamer).
It can be used as a terminal client, tui interface or via a networked web interface.
The individual clients exchange messages via so-called websockets, e.g. when switching to the next song.
Songs can be displayed in different modes:

- Musican
- Beamer Control
- Beamer

## Installation

Currently it is unfortunately only possible to compile and install the program from source.
Also, currently only Linux is supported as a platform. However, we hope to be able to support Windows and MacOS soon.

## Formats

### Song

The song format is almost identical to the well-known ChordPro format

- A section goes always so long, until either the end of the file is reached, or a new section is defined
- After "&" a translation can be given

```
{title: Testsong}
{key: C}
{section: Intro}
[C F G C]
{section: Chorus}
[F]This [G]is a [C]line & Das ist eine Zeile
```

### Setlist

A setlist is a list of song titles that are assigned a key.
The song is automatically transposed to the specified key when this setlist is displayed.
Self" uses the original specified key of the song.

```
Testsong;G
OtherSong;Self
```
